# Swift PESEL Validator App

## Overview

The Swift PESEL Validator App is a tool designed to verify and extract information from a Polish PESEL (Universal Electronic System for Registration of the Population) number. It provides a user-friendly interface to input a PESEL number and outputs the validity status as well as key demographic information embedded in the number.

## Purpose

This application is built as an exercise to demonstrate proficiency in Swift, specifically using the MVC architectural pattern. The main goal of the application is to validate PESEL numbers and derive information from them, such as birth date, gender, etc. This application also includes Unit Tests to ensure the correct functioning of the validation logic and extraction of information.

## Features

- **PESEL Validation:** Users can enter a PESEL number, and the application will validate it for correctness.
- **Information Extraction:** Once validated, the application can extract key information from the PESEL number, such as the birth date and gender of the individual.
